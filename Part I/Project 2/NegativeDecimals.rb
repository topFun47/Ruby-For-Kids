# Ruby For Kids Project 2: Big Numbers
# Programmed By: Chris Haupt
#   Using a combination of your terminal program
# and Interactive Ruby to do quick experiments
# that let you try new things with Ruby.
# Code Tested By: Pavel Stepanov
# Extra Credit: Can Ruby store negative numbers?
#               What about decimals?

puts "Can Ruby store negative numbers?"
puts " How about decimals?"
puts " "
puts " Yes, Ruby can store negative numbers"
puts "  and decimals"
puts " "
puts "As you can see here if I add two negative numbers together"
puts "  like -5 + -10 Ruby will show #{-5 + -10} as the answer."
puts " "
puts "And if I add two decimals together like this 1.25 + 1.25 "
puts " Ruby will show #{1.25 + 1.25} as the answer. "
puts " "
puts "So if I make a = -15, and b = 2.5. Than adding a + b together"
a = -15
b = 2.5
puts " Ruby will show #{a + b} as the answer. Meaning that Ruby"
puts " stored a negative number and a decimal number as variables,"
puts " and was able to come up with an answer without error."
