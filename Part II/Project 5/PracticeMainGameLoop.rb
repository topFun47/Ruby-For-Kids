"Creating the Main Game Loop"
# For the adventure project, you're going to start creating the main game loop first, where the rules and input and output of the game are.
# Then you'll create small methods to implement the functionality you need to run the game.
# You'll program as if these methods already exist and use Ruby to help fill in the missing functionality.

"Creating the room description and actions"
# First, you'll need to let the player know what's going on during that turn and describe what the player can do.

#1. Each turn , the player will have a number of options of what to do on her turn.
#   You'll use the actions variable to hold these choices in an array and reset the array each time you run through the game engine's loop.
#   You'll use the actions array to build a little menu for the user shortly.
#   Put the following code inside the while loop:
 actions = []

#2. Print
puts ""

#3. You'll
puts current_room

#4. Now
if monster
  puts
  actions <<
end

#5. Finally
  print

"Responding to player actions"
# Now it's time to get the player's command choice and have the game respond to it.

#1. Collect
  player_action = gets
  if
    damage_points
    puts
    end

#3. If the player
